### What is it?

- It's a tiny command line tool for Windows 10/11
- It's named `cdis.exe` where "cdis" stands for "**C**ontrol**D**isplay**I**nput**S**ource"
- It uses DDC/CI to control the input source of a DDC-capable display/monitor
- It does this by using the Windows API
- It runs on any Windows 10/11 machine
- Its release binary/executable has a size of ~12KB
- It's a .NET Framework 4.8 console application and it's written in C#
- It's developed by using the more modern SDK-style project format in ".csproj" file
- It's developed with Visual Studio 2022 17.12.1 (Community Edition)
- It has no dependencies to anything (no 3rd party library, etc.)
- It's built by using the global `dotnet` tools on the command line
- It's built on a Windows 11 machine (Windows 11 version 23H2 build 22631.4460)
- It's built and published as a .NET Framework 4.8 assembly/executable
- It doesn't require any runtime-installation (Windows 10/11 has the runtime by default)
- It's the result of my early [ControlDisplayInputSource](https://github.com/MBODM/ControlDisplayInputSource) experiments
- It's the direct successor of my later [cdis2410](https://github.com/MBODM/cdis2410) and [cdis2410-net48](https://github.com/MBODM/cdis2410-net48) tools
- It's free to use and open source (under MIT license)

### Why it exists?

It's possible to change the input source of a computer's display by software (in contrast to the hardware buttons of your display). Typically by using DDC/CI commands. The DDC VCP60 command is the key component here.

I was just looking for a simple way to quickly switch my display's input source between 3 computers, with just one click. I found some tools out there (which all use DDC/CI too, of course). But i decided to build a simple and tiny tool by myself, which i can use in scripts or Windows Desktop shortcuts.

As a result, this tool was born.

### How to use?

The tool itself should be rather self-explanatory. Just use the `--cap` argument to see which VCP60 values your display supports. Each VCP60 value represents one physical input source of your display. Either you just test each VCP60 value (by using the `--set` argument), or you take a look into your display's user manual, to find out which VCP60 value corresponds to which physical input source. By using the `--get` argument you can see which VCP60 value (and therefore the corresponding input source) is currently active.

### Why .NET Framework 4.8?

So, why i published that tool as a .NET Framework 4.8 (NET48) application, instead of a more modern .NET 8.0 (NET8) AOT application? I specifically said "published" here, instead of "developed", since the source code is 99% the same, for both.

##### 1) Basics

Here are some key facts, you need to know first, to make the decision more easy to explain from my side and more clear to understand on your side:
- In .NET "_self-contained_" means "runs stand-alone" and "_framework-dependent_" means "needs a specific runtime".
- An empty NET8 console application, published as _self-contained_ (with active _trim_ option) is ~11MB in size.
- Same empty NET8 console application, with _AOT-complilation_ active, is ~1.3MB in size.
- An empty NET48 console application is ~7KB in size (because NET48 is _framework-dependent_ in general).
- Windows 11 (all versions) and Windows 10 ("May 2019 Update" or later) include the NET48 runtime by default.
- In 2017 .NET Core 2.0 introduced a new project format, called "SDK-style project format" (SSPF).
- Most of the best features of modern NET8 platform, publishing/deployment-wise, are the result of SSPF.
- A NET48 project can also make use of the more modern SSPF (for "How?" see the section below).

That said, this means if you want to make sure the compiled binary runs on all Windows 10/11 machines out of the box (without any further pre-requirements) you obviously have 2 options:
- Create a .NET 8 console application and publish it _self-contained_
- Create a .NET Framework 4.8 console application (which is by default _framework-dependent_)

As said above, the latter one runs on any Windows 10/11 machine out of the box, even when _framework-dependent_ in general, cause Windows 10/11 has the .NET 4.8 Framework runtime installled by default. And even when the size difference is not that huge, i decided to stick with the NET48 route. And here is why:
- My primary goal is: "_The published binary shall run out of the box, with no further requirements_"
- I want to target solely Windows 10/11 machines (since not that many peoples use older versions)
- Means: I achieve my primary goal by both above options (_self-contained_ NET8, or _framework_dependent_ NET48)
- In code there is also zero use of anything special (specific to NET8 or C#12)
- I still have the best publish/deployment features (since NET48 also can use SSPF)

The binary size battle is, of course, easy to win for NET48, since it's _framework_dependent_ in general. Which means all the used .NET functionalities (libraries) will exist outside of the binary, in the separate installed runtime. Whereas for _self-contained_ all the used functionalities are compiled into the binary itself. Which results, of course, in a bigger binary.

But i just thought:

"_Hmm, when it completely doesn't matter anyway, why not just stick with the smaller binary size, when i have no other real benefit at all?_"

That's why.

##### 2) _How to use "SDK-style project format" for a .NET 4.8 Framework project?_

The following was done, to use the more modern _SDK-sytle project format_, with .NET 4.8 as framework:
- First created a .NET 8 console application
- Changed _Target Framework Moniker_ in project (".csproj" file) to `net48` (instead of `net8.0`)
- Removed `<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>` setting there (since it's C# 7.3 now)
- Removed `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` setting there (since it's C# 7.3 now)
- Added missing `using` statements in all source files (as result of above `<ImplicitUsings>` change)
- Published with default setttings (in a `net48` project you can't change them)

### Older Windows versions?

So, what about running `cdis.exe` on older Windows versions, before Windows10/11?

##### Windows 7/8

In general, this tool runs on Windows 7/8 as well. You just need to separately install the .NET Framework 4.8 runtime on those Windows versions (you can download the runtime from Microsoft). That's all.

##### Windows Vista and older

To make it run on even older Windows versions, you just need to download the source, set an older target framework (like in example .NET Framework 4.6) and re-compile it. You can find more information [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies).

##### Fictional NET8 handling

That said, even when i (fictionally) would stick to the NET8 route (see [section](#why-net-framework-48) above), it would be also very simple, to make `cdis.exe` running on older Windows versions. Knowing myself, i would not offer published binaries for that Windows versions, ready-to-download, on the [Releases](https://github.com/mbodm/cdis/releases) page, out of the box. I would be just too lazy to do this by myself, for sure. ðŸ˜„ Cause the target audience is just not that huge, in my opinion. But nonetheless, it would be also rather easy to do this on your own: You would just need to download the source and compile it as _framework-dependent_, instead of _self-contained_. Then you could install the separate .NET 8.0 or .NET 6.0 runtime on Windows 7/8 and `cdis.exe` runs like a charm. You can find more information [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows#windows-7--81--server-2012).

In short: Regardless what, it's super easy to make `cdis.exe` running on many older Windows platforms.

### Fine, anything else?

A suggestion or "_How to switch the input source, by using the keyboard?_" (this is how i personally use the tool):

Since `cdis.exe` is a CLI tool, you can use it in scripts or shortcuts. Personally, i created 2 different `cdis.exe --set [NUMBER]` Windows Desktop shortcuts (".lnk" files). One for each of my other 2 computers. For each Windows Desktop shortcut i defined a keyboard hotkey (right-click and select "Properties"). In example something like "SHIFT+ALT+RIGHTARROW". This way you just need to press those keys on your keyboard, to quickly switch to another computer. Hint: You can also pin Windows Desktop shortcuts to "Start" or the Windows TaskBar.

The only downside of this "trick" is: Sometimes Windows adds a small delay (1-2 seconds), when using the keyboard hotkey. You can read this [superuser blogpost](https://superuser.com/questions/426947/slow-windows-desktop-keyboard-shortcuts) to see why and which solutions exist.

#### Have fun.
