# cdis

A tiny Windows command line tool to change a display's input source by using DDC/CI

### What is it?

- It's a tiny command line tool for Windows 10/11
- It's named `cdis.exe` where "cdis" stands for "**C**ontrol**D**isplay**I**nput**S**ource"
- It uses DDC/CI to control the input source of a DDC-capable display/monitor
- It does this by using the Windows API
- It runs on any Windows 10/11 machine
- Its release binary (executable) has a size of ~12KB
- It's a .NET Framework 4.8 console application and it's written in C#
- It has no dependencies to anything (no 3rd party library, etc.)
- It's developed by using the more modern SDK-style project format in ".csproj" file
- It's developed with Visual Studio 2022 17.12.1 (Community Edition)
- It's built by using the global `dotnet` tools on the command line
- It's built on a Windows 11 machine (Version 23H2)
- It's built and published as a .NET Framework 4.8 executable (_framework-dependent_)
- It doesn't require any runtime-installation (Windows 10/11 has the runtime by default)
- It's the result of my early [ControlDisplayInputSource](https://github.com/MBODM/ControlDisplayInputSource) experiments
- It's the direct successor of my [cdis2410](https://github.com/MBODM/cdis2410) and [cdis2410-net48](https://github.com/MBODM/cdis2410-net48) tools
- It's free to use and open source (under MIT license)

### Why it exists?

It's possible to change the input source of a computer's display by software (in contrast to the hardware buttons of your display). Typically by using DDC/CI commands. The DDC VCP60 command is the key component here.

I was just looking for some simple way to quickly switch my display's input source between 3 computers, with just one click. I found some tools out there (which all use DDC/CI too, of course). But i decided to build a simple and tiny tool by myself, which i can use in scripts or Windows Desktop shortcuts.

As a result, this tool was born.

### How to use?

The tool itself should be rather self-explanatory. Just use the `--cap` argument to see which VCP60 values your display supports. Each VCP60 value represents one physical input source of your display. Either you just test each VCP60 value (by using the `--set` argument), or you take a look into your display's user manual, to find out which VCP60 value corresponds to which physical input source. By using the `--get` argument you can see which VCP60 value (and therefore the corresponding input source) is currently active.

### Nice, anything else?

"_How to switch the display input source by using the keyboard?_"

A quick personal suggestion (this is how i use the tool):

Since `cdis.exe` is a CLI tool, you can use it in scripts and shortcuts. Personally, i created myself 2 different `cdis.exe --set [NUMBER]` Windows Desktop shortcuts (".lnk" files). One for each of my 2 other computers. For each Windows Desktop shortcut i defined a keyboard hotkey (right-click and select "Properties"). In example, something like "SHIFT+ALT+LEFTARROW". This way i just need to press those keys on the keyboard to quickly switch to another computer. Hint: You can also pin Windows Desktop shortcuts to "Start" or to the Windows TaskBar.

The only downside of this "trick": Sometimes Windows adds a small delay (1-2 seconds), when using the keyboard hotkey shortcut. You can read more about it in this [superuser blogpost](https://superuser.com/questions/426947/slow-windows-desktop-keyboard-shortcuts) to see "_why?_" and which solutions exist.

### Why .NET Framework 4.8?

You will find a detailed answer to that question [here](https://github.com/mbodm/cdis/blob/main/NET48.md).

### Earlier Windows versions?

So, what about running `cdis.exe` on Windows versions, older than Windows 10/11?

##### 1) Windows 7/8

In general, this tool runs on Windows 7/8 as well, by default. You just need to separately install the .NET Framework 4.8 runtime on those Windows versions (you can download the runtime from Microsoft). That's all.

##### 2) Windows Vista and earlier

To make it run on even older Windows versions, you just need to download the source, set an older target framework (in example .NET Framework 4.6) and re-compile it. You can find more information [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies).

##### 3) Fictional NET8 handling

That said, even when i (fictionally) would stick to the NET8 route (see ["Why .NET Framework 4.8?](https://github.com/mbodm/cdis/NET48.md)"), it would be also very simple, to make `cdis.exe` running on older Windows versions.

Knowing myself, i would not offer published binaries for that Windows versions, out of the box and ready-to-download, on the [Releases](https://github.com/mbodm/cdis/releases) page. I would be just too lazy to do this by myself, for sure. ðŸ˜„ Cause the target audience is just not that huge, in my opinion.

But nonetheless, it would be also rather easy to do this on your own: You would just need to download the source and compile it as _framework-dependent_, instead of _self-contained_. Then you could install the separate .NET 8.0 or .NET 6.0 runtime on Windows 7/8 and `cdis.exe` would run like a charm. You can find more information [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows#windows-7--81--server-2012).

In short: Regardless what, it will always be super easy to make `cdis.exe` running on older Windows platforms.

**Have fun.**
